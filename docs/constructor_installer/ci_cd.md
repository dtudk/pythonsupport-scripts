- Automated version management and semantic versioning
- Production-quality build and test processes
- Professional release management with GitHub releases
- Code signing and notarization templates (for production)
- Zero-touch deployment pipeline
- Enterprise-ready artifact management

## Files

### Core Workflows
- `../../.github/workflows/production-release.yml` - Main production release workflow
- `workflows/code-signing-template.yml` - Template for Apple code signing and notarization

### Scripts
- `scripts/release.sh` - Automated release management script
- `scripts/` - Additional automation utilities

## Production Release Pipeline

### Automated Release Process

```bash
# Create production release
./scripts/release.sh 1.0.0

# Create pre-release
./scripts/release.sh 1.1.0-beta.1 --prerelease

# Create draft release
./scripts/release.sh 2.0.0 --draft
```

### Release Workflow Steps

1. **Version Validation**
   - Validates semantic version format
   - Checks for existing tags
   - Verifies release conditions

2. **Automated Building**
   - Builds Constructor Python PKG with version
   - Builds VSCode PKG component  
   - Creates unified DTU installer
   - Updates all version references

3. **Production Testing**
   - Installs and tests complete environment
   - Validates Python packages and VSCode integration
   - Runs comprehensive integration tests
   - Verifies enterprise deployment compatibility

4. **Release Creation**
   - Creates GitHub release with proper tagging
   - Generates comprehensive release notes
   - Uploads installer artifacts
   - Notifies stakeholders

## Key Features

### ✅ Zero-Touch Deployment
```yaml
# Trigger via tag
git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0

# Or manual dispatch
gh workflow run production-release.yml --field version=1.0.0
```

### ✅ Version Management
- Semantic versioning (1.0.0, 1.1.0-beta.1)

#### Production Requirements
```bash
# Required secrets for production signing
APPLE_ID=your-apple-id@domain.com
APPLE_ID_PASSWORD=app-specific-password
APPLE_TEAM_ID=XXXXXXXXXX
SIGNING_CERTIFICATE=base64-encoded-p12
CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD=certificate-password
```

## Version Management

### Semantic Versioning Strategy

#### Stable Releases
- `1.0.0` - Initial production release
- `1.1.0` - Feature updates
- `1.0.1` - Bug fixes and patches

#### Pre-releases

- `1.0.0-rc.1` - Release candidates
- `2.0.0-alpha.1` - Major version previews

### Automated Version Updates

The release process automatically updates:
- `construct.yaml` - Constructor version
- `build_combined.sh` - Distribution version
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Documentation dates
- Git tags and release notes
