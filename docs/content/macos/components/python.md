## Installation Scripts

### Main Miniconda Installation Script

**Path:** `MacOS/Components/Python/install.sh`

**Usage:** `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dtudk/pythonsupport-scripts/main/MacOS/Components/Python/install.sh)"`

**Description:** Main installation script that sets up Miniconda with proper configuration for Python development.

**What it does:**

1. **Dependency Check**: Ensures Homebrew is installed
2. **Miniconda Installation**: Installs Miniconda via Homebrew cask
3. **Shell Configuration**: Initializes conda for bash and zsh
4. **Channel Configuration**: 
   - Removes default channels (licensing concerns)
   - Adds conda-forge channel
   - Sets flexible channel priority

**Requirements:**

- Working Homebrew installation

**Expected Outcome:**

- `python3` command runs Python through Miniconda
- `conda` command available and configured
- Shell initialization complete for future sessions
